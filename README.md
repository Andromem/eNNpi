eNNpi
=====

A serial, standard library version of a neural network simulator - developed on the raspberry Pi.

This is a translation of an MFC app I wrote a while ago which was itself a translation of a BeOS app (yes it is that old).

I've translated it to run on standard library calls to make it more generic. I'm not going to extend the functionality of this program. My intention is to use this as a base line to compare it to a version for the parallella that I'll start writing when the parallella arrives.

I'll post versions that I think will work but I'm not the best tester in the word so the ususal disclaimers apply.
